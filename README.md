# ABCB1 haplotypes inference

The code presented in this repository was employed in the study titled "Intestinal P-gp Activity is Diminished in Postmenopausal Women Undergoing Breast Cancer Therapy," which has been submitted to Clinical and Translational Science (CTS), the official journal of the American Society for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics.

As the three SNPs in the _ABCB1_ gene have high proximity in the genome - 1236T>C (rs1128503), 2677T>G/A (rs2032582) and 3435T>C (rs1045642) - are in high linkage disequilibrium, these three SNPs will be isolated as diplotypes. _ABCB1_ diplotypes were inferred using the haplo.stats package (version 1.8.7)
